<h3>Description of the game:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your goal as a player is to reach as close as you can to 21, without going past 21, if you do happen to go over 21, you automatically lose.</li>
    <li>At first, you and the dealer are dealt 2 cards each. The best combo of those cards are an ACE and a FACE CARD/10. Since it's automatically equal to 21 and you win, that is called a blackjack.</li>
    <li>The number cards are worth the same number that's on them.</li>
    <li>The J,Q,K have a value of 10.</li>
    <li>The ace has 2 values, 11 and 1. If you are below 21 you can use 11, otherwise it gets exchanged for a value of 1.</li>
    <li>The dealer must stand on 17, even if that 17 is including an ace.</li>
    <li>You win if you are closer to 21 than the dealer, or if the dealer goes past 21.</li>
    <li>You lose if you are further from 21 than the dealer, or if you go past 21.</li>
    <li>You get your money back, or PUSH, if you and the dealer have the same amount of sum.</li>
    <li>You can DOUBLE when you have enough money to do another bet, and only after you have been dealt the starting 2 cards.</li>
    <li>You can HIT until you go above 21, it is called asking for another card.</li>
    <li>You can STAND only once, after that, the dealer goes on and he hits until he's beat you or gone above 21 or reached 17.</li>

<h4>The whole thing initial game was done in less than 12 hours!
Bug fixes have been coming to the game every 5-6 hours, as of now.
More updates to follow!</h4>
<p>One known bug is the option that the game doesn't scale well on the 100% display scailling setting, since I made it on a laptop, in order to get the proper experience, run your display at 125% Scailling, and then start the game again!.
Trying to work out a fix! </p>
